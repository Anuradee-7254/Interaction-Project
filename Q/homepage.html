        <h1>WHAT IS <span class="highlight">BMI?</span></h1>
        <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value derived from an individual's weight and height.
           It is used as a simple and quick screening tool to categorize people into different weight categories,
           which can indicate potential health risks associated with being underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
           While BMI is a useful tool and can give a general indication of whether an individual has a healthy body weight,
           it does have limitations. BMI does not directly measure body fat, and it does not take into account factors such as muscle mass, bone density,
           overall body composition, and racial and sex differences.<br>
           <br>It's important to use BMI along with other health assessments and indicators for a complete evaluation of an individual's health.
           Consulting healthcare professionals for personalized advice is recommended.

        <h1>HOW TO MANAGE WEIGHT</h1>
        <p>To avoid the risk of various illnesses, we need to maintain our health and keep our weight within a suitable range.
            Effective weight management is actually not as difficult as it seems. It involves controlling your diet and engaging in regular exercise.</p>

                <div class="foodparagraph-col">
                    <h3>FOOD</h3>
                    <p>Diet control is not about starving yourself. The key to maintaining a healthy weight is to consume a balanced diet with all five food groups in appropriate amounts according to nutritional guidelines.
                    For example, working women should aim to consume 1,200-1,600 calories per day, while working men should aim for 1,800-2,000 calories per day, depending on their daily activities.<br>
                    <br>For those who engage in intense physical activity, such as athletes, a higher caloric intake may be appropriate. Conversely, individuals with significant obesity should gradually reduce their calorie intake rather than making abrupt cuts.
                    Medical advice suggests that a gradual reduction of 500 calories per day can help achieve an average weight loss of 1-2 kilograms per month.</p>

                    <h3>EXERCISE</h3>
                    <p>After establishing a balanced diet, it's crucial to pair it with consistent exercise. Physical activity burns extra calories and helps rebuild muscle mass that may have been lost during weight reduction.
                     This balance supports weight maintenance and overall long-term health. Exercise also improves cardiovascular health, enhances mood, boosts energy levels, and can even help manage and prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.<br>
                     <br>An effective exercise regimen should involve physical activity three times a week, with each session lasting between 20 to 60 minutes. It's important to incorporate a mix of aerobic exercises, such as running,
                     cycling, or swimming, and strength training exercises, like weightlifting or body-weight exercises, to target different aspects of fitness. Stretching and flexibility exercises, such as yoga or Pilates, can also be beneficial for maintaining a range of motion and preventing injuries.
                     For individuals who are significantly overweight, starting with light activities such as walking or gently moving different body parts is recommended.
                     Consulting a healthcare professional or a certified fitness trainer can provide personalized guidance and support to ensure safe and effective exercise practices.</p>

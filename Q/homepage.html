        <h1>WHAT IS <span class="highlight">BMI?</span></h1>
        <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value derived from an individual's weight and height.
           It is used as a simple and quick screening tool to categorize people into different weight categories,
           which can indicate potential health risks associated with being underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
           While BMI is a useful tool and can give a general indication of whether an individual has a healthy body weight,
           it does have limitations. BMI does not directly measure body fat, and it does not take into account factors such as muscle mass, bone density,
           overall body composition, and racial and sex differences.<br>
           <br>It's important to use BMI along with other health assessments and indicators for a complete evaluation of an individual's health.
           Consulting healthcare professionals for personalized advice is recommended.

        <h1>HOW TO MANAGE WEIGHT</h1>
        <p>To avoid the risk of various illnesses, we need to maintain our health and keep our weight within a suitable range.
            Effective weight management is actually not as difficult as it seems. It involves controlling your diet and engaging in regular exercise.</p>

                    <h3>FOOD</h3>
                    <p>Managing your diet isn’t about depriving yourself but about consuming a well-balanced diet with appropriate portions from all five food groups.
                     For instance, women who are active in their work should aim for 1,200-1,600 calories a day, while men should target 1,800-2,000 calories,
                     depending on their level of physical activity.<br><br>
                     It's also important to focus on the quality of your food. Choose nutrient-rich foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and high-quality proteins,
                     and avoid those high in sugar, fats, and processed ingredients to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.<br><br></p>

                    <p>Pairing a balanced diet with regular exercise is essential for maintaining weight and promoting overall health.
                     Exercise helps burn excess calories, rebuild lost muscle mass, and supports long-term wellness. It also enhances cardiovascular health, mood, and energy levels,
                     and can prevent chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.<br><br>
                     A good exercise routine should include activity three times a week, with sessions lasting 20-60 minutes.
                     Beginners, especially those who are significantly overweight, should start with lighter activities and consider seeking guidance from a healthcare professional or certified trainer for personalized advice.</p>
